      <h1>Welcome to La Salle ACM</h1>
      <p>
        We represent La Salle's chapter of the ACM organization. Our goal as a
        club is to provide those interested in computer science and IT to
        connect with other students, gain opportunities, and utilize skills
        outside of the classroom.
        <br />
        <br />
        We have a wide variety of events throughout the year, from hackathons
        and competitions to exciting talks and career expos. We also will hold a
        few social events throughout the year. No matter who you are, we are a
        great resource if you are interested in technology.
